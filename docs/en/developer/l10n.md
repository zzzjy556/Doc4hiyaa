**You can follow these steps to support localization when developing new features**  

## Introduction
1. You can directly use the text configuration already available in `/resource/l10n/en-US.toml` to replace the text in the new feature.
2. If there is new text in the new feature, please refer to the configuration text in `en-US.toml`, pull the new text into the configuration files of other languages such as `en-US.toml`, and add translations.  

## Adding a new localized text file
1. Add a new language text configuration in `/resource/l10n/`.
2. Pull existing text configurations from other languages in the new language text configuration.
3. Add translations for the new language text configuration.
